# SSH Deployer

Deploy a web application securely using a familiar in-browser interface served over HTTP through an SSH tunnel.

## Prototype
All code used in the prototype will be placed under the open source licence GNU GPLv3, and hosted on GitHub.

**Website**
* Mobile optimised
* Touch optimised
* Responsive design
* Material design
* Validates as much input as possible on client-side
* Interface hosted at [ankitpati.in/ssh-deployer](https://ankitpati.in/ssh-deployer "SSH Deployer"), [ankitpati.in/ssh-deployer/workspace.html](https://ankitpati.in/ssh-deployer/workspace.html "Workspace")

**Web Server**
* LAMP stack (Ubuntu 16.06, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
* Robust server-side logic to prevent SQL injection and other attacks
* Validates all input; discards bogus inputs

### Execution
The prototype will be a fully functional system that can be migrated onto a public cloud infrastructure like Google or Amazon, and pressed into service right away.
